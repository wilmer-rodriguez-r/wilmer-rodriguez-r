<h2 align="center"> Hi! I'm Wilmer Rodr√≠guez <br/></h2>

## üí´ About Me:
I am a systems engineer from the Universidad Escuela Colombiana de Ingenieros Julio Garavito. I currently work as an architect, especially on issues related to cloud platforms such as AWS. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to gain experience working with various technologies and programming languages, such as Python and Java, which has allowed me to develop robust and efficient technological solutions.

I am passionate about data, especially everything related to analytics and model building with Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

My goal as a professional is to continue polishing my technical skills to create innovative solutions that not only optimize processes, but also contribute to the welfare and benefit of people.
